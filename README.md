# TensorFlow Lite Object Detection

This repository contains code for object detection using a TensorFlow Lite model. The code allows you to perform inference on images, providing the count of detected objects. Additionally, it supports calculating mAP (mean Average Precision)

## Features

- **Object Detection:** Utilize a TensorFlow Lite model to detect objects in images.
- **Count Objects:** Retrieve the count of detected objects in each image.
- **mAP Calculation:** Evaluate model performance by calculating mAP using the mAP project.


> In this repo My motive only calculate the number of object in given image
